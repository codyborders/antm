# Hackathon Starter Kit

Build systems that can extract, transform, and reason over complex retail data.

**Competition Platform:** [hack.theoryvc.com](https://hack.theoryvc.com)

---

## The Challenge

We all have our favorite frameworks and "hobby horses." Are you convinced that DSPy, LangGraph, or LlamaIndex is the true secret sauce? Do you believe that running 10 agents in parallel is the key to productivity? It's time to find out.

**The challenge:** Reliably extract, transform, and reason over complex, messy, and diverse data that simulates real enterprise environments.

You'll work with:
- Structured data (24 database tables in Parquet format)
- Unstructured data (PDFs with contracts, invoices, policies)  
- Logs (JSONL event streams)

**Your goal:** Answer business questions accurately and efficiently. Use whatever approach works.

## Competition Structure

### Three Rounds

**Round 1: Training Round** (12:30 PM - 2:00 PM)

- No submission required

**Round 2: Test Round** (2:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
- 30 questions without answers

- This is the main competition

**Round 3: Holdout Evaluation** (After 6:00 PM)

### Scoring
- **Test Round:** 70% of final score
- **Holdout Round:** 30% of final score

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Recommended:** Use a virtual environment to avoid common issues (especially on macOS):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r example/requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name "modeler-starter" --display-name "Python 3 (Modeler Starter)"
```

**Alternative:** System-wide installation (may fail on macOS):
```bash
pip install -r example/requirements.txt
```

See [`example/SETUP.md`](example/SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

### 2. Inspect the Dataset

All required files ship inside this repo under `dataset/`:

```bash
ls dataset
```

You'll use these Parquet tables, logs, and PDFs directly in the notebook—no extra generation steps needed.

### 3. Open the Tools Guide

```bash
jupyter notebook example/tools_guide.ipynb
```

This notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and querying data with DuckDB
- Searching logs and PDFs with LanceDB
- Understanding the question format
- Creating your submission file

### 4. (Optional) Set Up OpenRouter for AI Models

OpenRouter provides access to Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and other models through one API.

Get your API key: [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_OPENROUTER_KEY"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a SQL query to get the first 5 rows from a table"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 5. (Optional) Use the MCP Server

Contestants have access to a pre-configured **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that provides direct access to the hackathon dataset via MotherDuck. This allows you to integrate the dataset directly into AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) or custom agents.

**MCP Server URL:** `https://antm-hack-example.fastmcp.app/mcp`

**Quick Setup:** Visit [https://antm-hack-example.fastmcp.app](https://antm-hack-example.fastmcp.app) for easy integration with OpenAI SDK, Codex CLI, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini CLI.

**Connectors:** If you visit the base URL (`https://antm-hack-example.fastmcp.app`) without the `/mcp` path, you'll see a list of connectors to make it easy to add the server to your custom agents or chat clients.

**Source Code:** The MCP server source code is available at [github.com/tdoehmen/mcp-server-motherduck-example](https://github.com/tdoehmen/mcp-server-motherduck-example) if you want to deploy your own instance or understand how it works.

**Features:**
- Execute SQL queries on the hackathon dataset
- List all tables in the database
- Access DuckDB SQL syntax reference
- Read-only access with query timeouts and result limits

## Understanding the Data

### Three Types of Data

**1. Structured Data (Parquet Files)**
- 24 tables: customers, sales, items, stores, etc.
- Query with DuckDB (fast SQL on Parquet)
- Example questions: Aggregations, joins, time-series analysis

**2. Unstructured Data (PDFs)**
- Contracts, policies, invoices
- Extract with PDF parsers or LanceDB (semantic search)
- Example questions: Extract costs, dates, terms

**3. Logs (JSONL Files)**
- Clickstreams, experiments, events
- Parse with pandas, DuckDB, or LanceDB
- Example questions: Count events, analyze patterns, correlations

### Tool Selection

| Tool | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **DuckDB** | Tabular data, SQL queries | Aggregations, joins, filters |
| **LanceDB** | Logs, PDFs, semantic search | Finding events, extracting text |
| **Both** | Complex multi-source queries | Combining PDFs + logs + tables |

---

## Submission Format

Submissions must follow the leaderboard schema:

```csv
index,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5
0,9104725,TRUE,42.1875,vpm2k6zqf,Avery
```

**Key Points:**
- `index` starts at 0 and increments with each question.
- `a1`–`a5` correspond to the five answer slots per question (numeric, boolean, float, string, string).
- Fill unused slots with an empty string if a question requires fewer answers.

See `sample_submission.csv` for the up-to-date template.

## Strategy Tips

### Recommendations
- Start with training evals - they include answers
- Use the tools notebook to learn DuckDB and LanceDB
- Explore different approaches and find what works
- Test your system on various question types

### Common Pitfalls
- Hardcoding answers (holdout eval will catch this)
- Skipping logs/PDFs (many questions require them)
- Waiting until the last minute

### Time Management
- **12:30-1:30 PM:** Training round - explore the data
- **1:30-2:30 PM:** Build your approach/system
- **2:30-5:00 PM:** Answer test questions
- **5:00-6:00 PM:** Final checks and submit
